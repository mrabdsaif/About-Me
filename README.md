**In This Reading file I will be illustrating what we have done for this web page:**

Firstly, I was thinking about the needed time to finlaize this web page, and it took 4 days to be done with it to get the final results, as shown now when you open this page.

But I think it took 4 days due to we were learning step by step, now the way of using the tools and the functions in our minds and in our hands so I think it will take shorter time in the coming trials.

Meanwhile, we were working on the html doc, css file and Jscript file. It was a challenge. Eventually I think the second time we can finalize a web page in a shorten time.

#### The Steps:
* I Built and drew the structure that we need.
* I started to reflect this structure into the web using the html file.
* I spacified a suitable places of the elements. (headings, paragraphs, lists..etc).
* Using Css file we identified some properties for each element.
* Defining variables and show a pop ups, so the user can interact with it, and do some input processes.
* Then I used If statement to conduct some conditions and force the user to go in specific track.
* I used loops (Using for and while loop) for some conditions.
* Eventually We defined functions to be a container for the above conditions, and as I saw, The functions were so helpful to make the js well organized and this was helpful to run many codes in just only one function.
